I'm still learning with it comes to python and having the most basic of flaws throw trouble at me, so there's bound to be some features lacking as well as some extra code left in at times that may not have gotten cleaned up at release time.</description>

  	<summary>A Python FTPD Server.  Restart XBMC once after installing before use.  Graphics by Surfer.</summary>
  	<description>Graphics by Surfer.  This is basically a service project to handle the running of a nice FTP Server I found code for, as noted in the changelog.txt.  This is ment to eventually be for quick and easy use of even semi-newb-users, but for now is mainly meant for Advanced Users, until things get weeded out and more people come to understand how it works.  Restart XBMC once after installing before use.</description>
  	<disclaimer lang="en">This Project is designed for XBMC v13.0.x originally and currently being kept up on one of the monthly xbmc v13.0.x alpha builds. It gets a slight bit of testing as I use it myself, a LOT, on a Windows 7 OS. Most other OS's / builds of xbmc have not be tested on yet, but I do feel free to try and test it out on them. Some parts of this addon may not be legal in your country of residence - please check with your local laws before installing. I take no responsibility for any problems this plugin might in any way, form, shape or size cause. This is project is for a LEARNING EXPERIANCE.</disclaimer>
