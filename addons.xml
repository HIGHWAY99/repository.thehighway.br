  	<description>This branch of Repository Highway is an attempt to make addons available for Eden too..  A somewhat simple Repository Browser.

  	<disclaimer>This Project is developped for XBMC Gotham 13.0 Alpha 6, designed for XBMC Gotham originally, with some mind given to Frodo 12.2/12.3. It gets a slight bit of testing as I use it myself, on a Windows 7 OS with whatever version of XBMC happens to be my main install at that time. Any other OS's / builds of XBMC have not be tested on yet, but do feel free to try and test it out on them. Some parts of this addon may not be legal in your country of residence - please check with your local laws before installing. I take no responsibility for any problems this plugin might in any way, form, shape or size cause. This is project is for a LEARNING EXPERIANCE.</disclaimer>

I'm aware that GoodDrama isn't anime, but it was a simular site linked to by one or more of the others... so I tossed it into the plugin as well for you jdrama fans. I'm still learning with it comes to python and having the most basic of flaws throw trouble at me, so there's bound to be some features lacking as well as some extra code left in at times that may not have gotten cleaned up at release time.</description>
