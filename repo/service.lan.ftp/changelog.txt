[B]FTP Server - 0.0.3[/B]
- Time for another test phase.
- A Time-out setting is in Addon Settings now, which basically determines how often the server is restarted/checked to see if the setting for running is enabled/disabled.  This can probably be tweaked some, slightly, by advanced users.
- default.py via Program Addons - Added menu with the following: Enable/Disable-Server, Show Settings, Server Status.
- Finally the server will now do a lot better job starting/stopping/restarting/stopping-again.
- Many attempts to sort out shutdown of the ftpd server.
- Should hopefully block future "new" ip's from connecting if server is disabled in addon settings. #FTPServer()._accept_new_cons()
