  	<disclaimer lang="en">This Project is designed for xbmc v13.x originally and currently being kept up on one of the nightly xbmcc v13.x builds. It gets a slight bit of testing as I use it myself, a LOT, on a Windows 7 OS. Any other OS's / builds of xbmc have not be tested on yet, but I do feel free to try and test it out on them. Some parts of this addon may not be legal in your country of residence - please check with your local laws before installing. I take no responsibility for any problems this plugin might in any way, form, shape or size cause. This is project is for a LEARNING EXPERIANCE.
