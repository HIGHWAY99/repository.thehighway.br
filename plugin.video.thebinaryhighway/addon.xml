    <summary lang="en">This addon is a 3rd Party Plugin for XBMC.</summary>
    <description lang="en">This addon is now a fun little project to learn from and work on building a tool of my own for providing use of tools, fixes and the such, as well as, making available common repositories and examples of doing sub-addons, including many of my own and some example ones for other addons you might like to try...  This plugin is was to be a remake of TheAnime[COLOR tan]Highway[/COLOR] (plugin.video.theanimehighway).  It is my hope to make some improvements apon my original addon and make it a bit easier to add new handled sites and go back in to make fixes.
